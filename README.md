> Cost averaging is a simple technique that entails investing a fixed amount of money in the same fund, stock or CRYPTOCURRENCY at regular intervals over a long period of time.

### Idea

The main idea on this project is to be able to cost average on any well known exchange and the coins that they have. Not beeing restricted on the exchange functionalities.

- The solid line represents the price that was paid; and
- The dashed line represents your average price over the entire period.

### Todo-list

The project is still under development and future updates may include:

- [ ] Upload to Apple Store
- [ ] Turn into a web version
- [ ] Find a way not to store users keys online
- [ ] Add all exchanges possibles

### Backend
The backend server was stopped due to high resource consumption to execute all the requests with public app running for free. Only the android app is running at the moment, but it is not able to execute orders automatically.
